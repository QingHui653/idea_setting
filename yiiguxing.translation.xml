      <item value="Returns a string representation of the first argument in the radix specified by the second argument. If the radix is smaller than Character.MIN_RADIX or larger than Character.MAX_RADIX, then the radix 10 is used instead. If the first argument is negative, the first element of the result is the ASCII minus character '-' ('\u002D'). If the first argument is not negative, no sign character appears in the result. The remaining characters of the result represent the magnitude of the first argument. If the magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the magnitude will not be the zero character. The following ASCII characters are used as digits: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz These are '\u0030' through '\u0039' and '\u0061' through '\u007A'. If radix is N, then the first N of these characters are used as radix-N digits in the order shown. Thus, the digits for hexadecimal (radix 16) are 0123456789abcdef. If uppercase letters are desired, the String.toUpperCase() method may be called on the result: Integer.toString(n, 16).toUpperCase()" />
