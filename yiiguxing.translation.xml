      <item value="This class defines only mutative methods requiring locking. * Except as noted, the methods of this class perform the * per-segment versions of ConcurrentHashMap methods. (Other * methods are integrated directly into ConcurrentHashMap * methods.) These mutative methods use a form of controlled * spinning on contention via methods scanAndLock and * scanAndLockForPut. These intersperse tryLocks with * traversals to locate nodes. The main benefit is to absorb * cache misses (which are very common for hash tables) while * obtaining locks so that traversal is faster once * acquired. We do not actually use the found nodes since they * must be re-acquired under lock anyway to ensure sequential * consistency of updates (and in any case may be undetectably * stale), but they will normally be much faster to re-locate. * Also, scanAndLockForPut speculatively creates a fresh node * to use in put if no node is found." />
      <item value="Segments maintain a table of entry lists that are always * kept in a consistent state, so can be read (via volatile * reads of segments and tables) without locking.
